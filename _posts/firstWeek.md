title: First Week of School
---

  To be honest, I did not want to come back to school after the internship, not to mention that I didn't want to take this class.  I did hear many positive things about Professor Downing from lots of friends, but I was just enjoying the working life.  After the first week of school, what people said about professor Downing's class were all true.  He is one of the best lecturer I've seen and I'm already excited about this class.  He said that getting an internship on your resume is basically the first and the easiest step to get a full time position.  Later, he explained the code from the projector screen to every single detail.  I do not have any experience with c++ but he said that's exactly what he was expecting.  Just from the first week, I've learned that #include is not the same as import in java.  Also "using" the namespace std is not required.  You can simply put std:: and put whatever function that you need.  
  I've never had the experience in unit testing.  After he expained the codes, it seems pretty simple, even though lots of things could go wrong when testing assertion.  I think giving us some sort of problem and figuring it out with someone next to you is a really good idea.  It gets us thinking and some sort of partner work, just like in real working environment.  I actually can't wait to go back and see what knowledge he'll be giving us next class.
  
  Tip: Don't trust all unit testing results.
