title: Week 2
---

  I can't believed I survived the first real week of school.  In Downing's object oriented programming class, I can really feel the knowledge coming in to me.  After taking the first few quizzes, I realized that simply paying attention in class and reading the assigned reading is not enough.  I really have to dig deep to understand everything fully.  I know I will have to start on the first assingment very soon.  It's really interesting when Downing's talking about the first project.  The list of solutions that can be used to solve that problem.  I would have never think of calculate a range of set numbers ahead of time and save it somewhere from the beginning.  Usually, we're taught by calculate whatever whenever the program runs.  This class is living up to its reputation, learning lots of things that actually useful in real job situations.
  
  Tip of the week:  Android M is Marshmallow and I called it.  It has a "visual voicemail",  I don't think it's useful, but who knows.
